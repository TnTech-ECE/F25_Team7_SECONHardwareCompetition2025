02/09 update:
  Angela and Jane are missing :(
  No updates from Storm
  Team 2 is presenting
  What to look out for:
  Are there any materials in the BOM that are in the capstone lab?
  Keep images clear and legible (think about having it at the expo)
  Have high-contrasting colors for readability.
  have a good tempo (practice beforehand)
  Make sure to have links to citations (footer or end)
  When you finish the presentation, upload it to ILearn for records
  Make sure to tie in standards and constraints to the detailed design
  Animations are good!
  How you are mounting hardware is important to discuss
  ~4 presentations per class
