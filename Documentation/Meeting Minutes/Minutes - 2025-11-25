Updates:
Aiden - I'm behind and need to update the subsystem without an Arduino Nano BLE
Jane - Not Finished (Might be wrong, but will be fixed) - but bulk is complete
Atra Niese - Doing good, not as much work because of her subsystem, but still working on how the interface should be formatted. And needs to do an analysis.
Torsten - Almost done, great paper, and a very good schematic. Just needs to do BOM.
Trevor and Angela are not here :(
