We were unable to meet with Dr. Camfield, and Atra-Niese is absent from this meeting :(

Updates: Completion of Project Proposal!!!

Goal: 
  -Work on Conceptual Design
    -Develop Subsystems and Assign Them

Subsystems:
  -Power Subsystem              (Probably Handled) (Maybe Torsten)

  -Safety Subsystem             (Torsten)
    -Safety System (Drone)
    -Safety System (Robot)

  -Motor Control Subsystem      (Angela)
    -Motor Control

  -Master Control Subsystem     (Jane)
    -Flight Control
    -Display
    -Communication between systems

  -Communication Subsystem      (Aiden)
    -Wireless Comms
    -IR Transmitter

  -Navigation Subsystem         (Atra-Niese)
    -Flight Control
    -Autonomous Pathing

  -Object Detection Subsystem   (Trevor)
    -Vision (drone)
    -Vision (robot)
    -Image Processing

  -Mechanical Subsystem (Designated to the ME team and 
    -Chassis
    -Duck Collection & Distribution
    -Keypad Mechanism
    -Crank Mechanism


Camfield Question:
  Buy or make a Drone?


Camfield Meeting:

Maybe add a Sensor Subsystem
Does the architecture subsystem need to be different?
Localization
Path Planning (Global and Local)
  -Planning initial Path
Navigation
Control?
High-level planner vs low-level planner
Global planner sees and organizes movement
Low-level planner does the dirty work (and small things)
Master control could be the Global Planner

Master Control: (Global decision-maker) [ROS]
and Localization, Path Planning, and mobile control in a continuous loop
but also Sensors

Make or Buy a drone?
  -Depends on time and resources
  -Also, how customized do we want?
  -Should probably buy a drone instead of creating one.

Do you have any tips on this big project?
  -Go to ROS (maybe a little overkill, and a learning curve)
    -Inherit stuff others do and use multithreading and communication
    -multithreading -> like using real-time interrupts and multiple activities happening at once
  -Make that decision soon and get a simulation running
  -Look at past examples
