All of us are here :(

Angela talked to a past team and found out that she did her part of the project proposal (ethics) wrong and needs to change it all. 
  -Will focus on an aspect of the project (and how it's beneficial to the customer)
  -ethics: how the micro UAV is safe, and mention any cons / how we would mitigate them.
    -potential points: needing to use lithium-ion batteries and the cons with those.

UPDATES:
  Intro & Background: Nothing much changed, just further clarification that SECON is the Southeast Conference (done)
  Specification and Constraints: Added some extra bits and specs (not finished (90%))
  Formulating the Problem: restructured and added a new section (unknown factors) (not finished (research done but needs formatting) (75%))
  Measures of success: added specifics for how we are measuring success, and added points that IEEE (not finished (needs formatting) (may need extra clarification))
  Resources: Added Dakota and other bits (done)
  Ethics: Needs to be rewritten (not done, but will be finished today)

  How do we want to format the naming conventions for the robot and drone?
    - UAV = drone
    - Robot = GR = ground robot

Q&A:
  -Do we estimate design time?

Further meetings will be held in the Capstone Lab (4th floor of BROWN) (due to library wifi ;( )

Tasks for the next time we meet:
  -Angela: Rewrite the ethics section
  -Jane: Follow up about the meeting with Dr. Camfield & finish up Formulating the Problem
  -Everyone: finish up respective sections for tomorrow (10/1)

GOAL FOR TOMORROW:
  -Get project proposal FINISHED and
