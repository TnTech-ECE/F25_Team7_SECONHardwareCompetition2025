Meeting with camfield on thursday

Updates on Conceptual design:
-Jane & Angela are missing :(
-Atra-Niese - Bulk of it done, needs to get a flow chart
-Torsten - Got it done completely, it's also very long
-Aiden - Got it mostly done, needs to add a bit, but has a flow chart
-Trevor - Needs some response from the ME team, but has the basics and is ready to complete

What needs to get done:
Copy/edit Intro and Problem Breakdown, get everyone's section added, and include comparative analysis

Question for Storm: How are we supposed to frame our comparative analysis?

GOAL: Get the conceptual design done for Camfield on Thursday
