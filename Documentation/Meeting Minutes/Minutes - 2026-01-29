2 ME team members meet up with us; they are registered for the competition.
  They changed the keypad from a robot arm to 4 solenoids.
  They will start flying the drone soon
  Apparently, the ME department is very lax on ordering; they are willing to buy the drone :)

Updates: 
  Dr. Storm will get the detailed design checked out soon*
  We need to realistically order within the next week and have a bill of materials ready
  Everyone should have the detailed design presentation finished soon
  Meeting time will now change to 2 pm on Friday (starting Friday the 6th)

Need:
  Send ME the link to the drone
  Finished Detailed Design Presentation
  Get BOM ready



2/2 update:
  How to do team critiques
    Each team member has a number. Fill out the section with your number. Yellow means self-evaluation
    If 2 or lower, it turns red, and you need to bring that up with Dr Storm
  Ordering
    pdf is on ILearn
    DO NOT ORDER FROM PROHIBITED VENDORS
    Reimbursement requires *prior* approval
    Please order through approved vendors - Lowe's requires coordination with Julie
    Team Leader is the ONE in charge of getting orders
    Submit all to Dr. Storm - make sure everything is there in one order form
    Double-check that everything is there
    PCBS: JLPB
      Special Instructions that are not in I-learn yet, we have a shared account
      Go to the website to get all the files (do all the steps, or they will reject it)
      "How to generate Gerber and drill files in Kicad."
      Then you will set everything up and send an email, and Julie will purchase it
  Example BOM is in ILearn
  Update on assignments - now allows text submissions!!!
  Presentation should be 10-15 minutes!!!  no real minimum/maximum, more like a guideline
  Detailed Design Presentation deadline is just the deadline to schedule the presentation
  We just have to be here during our class time
