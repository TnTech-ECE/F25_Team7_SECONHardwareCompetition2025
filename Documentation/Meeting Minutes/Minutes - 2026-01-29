2 ME team members meet up with us; they are registered for the competition.
  They changed the keypad from a robot arm to 4 solenoids.
  They will start flying the drone soon
  Apparently, the ME department is very lax on ordering; they are willing to buy the drone :)

Updates: 
  Dr. Storm will get the detailed design checked out soon*
  We need to realistically order within the next week and have a bill of materials ready
  Everyone should have the detailed design presentation finished soon
  Meeting time will now change to 2 pm on Friday (starting Friday the 6th)

Need:
  Send ME the link to the drone
  Finished Detailed Design Presentation
  Get BOM ready
