GOALS: Finish (Again) subsystems

Updates:
Storm threw back the deadline by a week
Aiden: The Comms system is mostly done for us; we can attach a Xiao esp32c3 to help out with IR transmission. Wifi will be built in and done with the given API/IP Address
Atra-Niese: Nav systems collect data and process it using ROS, sending data to the local motor controller.
Angela: Lower Level Controller Subsystem is almost done - has a draft block diagram and written explanation
Jane: Sticking with the Jetson Nano, NVIDIA has a ROS directory that has AI processes built exactly for what we need.  TX2 is like the Jetson Nano, but twice as good (but not sure it's something that we need)
Torsten: Can't really work on safety without knowing how the robot works :(
Trevor: Object Detection - incredibly complicated and ingrained in other subsystems

Meeting: ME Meeting went well. They are taking care of all the board stuff, but they are still trying to find out what they are doing :(
-Looked through last year's conceptual design doc, and they did pretty good :)

Drone:
  -Definitely needs to see color
  -work through wifi and waypoints

We will meet with Camfield next week with a completed Conceptual Design Draft

GOALS FOR NEXT TIME: -As close to the final draft as possible

Q for Storm: Do we need Camfield to sign off on the Conceptual Design?
