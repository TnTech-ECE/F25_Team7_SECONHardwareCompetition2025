Updates:
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS DONE!!!

We also need the detailed design presentation


We will join the ME's meeting on Monday, looking for details on their plan (Chassis and Robot arm)

Question for Storm: Do we have a separate file for each subsystem? (Last year's team did) - How to use software in a hardware diagram - 
Question for MEs: how would you like us to verify duck? How would you like us to duck?

To Do: Ask Dr. Camfield to sign the conceptual design.
