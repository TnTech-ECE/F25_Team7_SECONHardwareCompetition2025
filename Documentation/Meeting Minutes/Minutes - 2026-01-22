To Do:
Everyone needs to have a detailed design presentation ready before Monday, January 26th.
Can't fully do a Gantt chart until we know when we can order parts
Make sure to get safety training done
We should reach out to storm have an advanced timeline (we have comp in mid March)


Here are the notes for the Secon Info Meeting:

What is Southeast Con?
  Lots of AI, lots of professionals, and good for networking (to find a job)
  We compete, and there are 8 comps

	The grader will have 1 hour and 45 min to blind grade one of the essays
Networking

1/28 edit:
Detailed design presentation:
	-If you have gotten approval, let him know to get that presentation done (shoot him an email w/ a time slot)
	-When it comes to ordering, once DD is done and he is good with it, he can start ordering
	-When approved, we can merge to main
	-Prez doesn't have a due date, Doc is due on the 11th
	-After today, we will do the half/half split (we will meet monday) for a progress update/presentation/parts ordered.
	-We won't have official lectures and stuff unless something big is coming up
	-In terms of GitHub, future students might(?) not use
