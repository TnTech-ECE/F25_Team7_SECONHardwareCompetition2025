Overview of competition:
Build a robot to complete specific tasks with specific hardware.
  -There is a course where ducks are scattered
  -We must find, pick up, and move ducks to a certain area
  -We must read antennas and understand what color they are
  -on antenna, push a button / enter #'s in a keypad/rescue duck off pressure plate


Questions: 
  -Is the arena built?
  -Who are the MEs we are working with, and how/when do we get in contact?
  -Can we have clarification on how we are meant to create the bill of materials without fully designing the robot?
  -Do we have to have our project finished/built in March, or do we have to have it finalized by March?


Tasks:
  -Rough Draft due the 22nd
    -We will iron out the proposal in the meeting
  -Contributions and references due 23rd
    -We will "finish" our sections with a finalized message in the groupme/teams, fully submitted by the 27th
